Thoughts:

Dealing with projectiles was suprisingly easy
I lacked enemy variety, but 2 enemies isnt bad


==== 15 more mins ==== 

Gun doesnt animated but that will be fixed later
Make bullets not hit other enemies, or at least injure them
Shotgun should do more damage
Cap max health
fix shotgun spam


==== 1 More hour ==== 

Make it less floaty
shotgun should have some crunchy sounds but its really fun
enemies should have prediction when shooting
Particle Effects !!!!!!
Better wave system
Sound effects for everything
Hellhound style enemy, every 5 waves
More natural wave spawning
Add in gun model
Combos would be sweet
